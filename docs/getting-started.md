# Getting Started

## Installation
To install the latest stable release with the command-line tool:

	sudo npm -g install lark

On Windows, you don't need sudo:

	npm -g install lark

## Creating a New Sails Project
Create a new app:

	lark new testProject

Now lift the server:

	cd testProject
	lark run

At this point, if you visit (http://localhost:8003/) you will see the default home page.

Now, let's get Lark to do cool stuff.
